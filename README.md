When checked on, the player is now immune to all PVP damages, including direct attacks, arrows, TNTs... and can't damage other players.

The button unchecks itself after 20 minutes. One minute before unchecking, the player is notified with a chat message:

If a player is immune to PVP, an icon will display next to its nametag:

You can change the icon you are displaying to others in the skin settings.
